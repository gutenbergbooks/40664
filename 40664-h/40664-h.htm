<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>When I began to write these stories about children of
all lands I had just returned from Europe whither I journeyed
with Marie and Ref. Maybe you don't know Marie
and Ref. I'll introduce them: Please meet Marie, my very
little daughter, and Ref, my very big reflex camera.</p>

<p>These two are my helpers. Marie helps by being a little
girl who knows what other little girls like and by telling
me; and Ref helps by snapping pictures of everything
interesting that Marie and I see on our travels. I couldn't
get along without them.</p>

<p>Several years have gone by since we started our work
together and Marie is a bigger girl&mdash;but Ref hasn't
changed one bit. Ref hasn't changed any more than my interest
in writing these books for you. And I hope that <i>you</i>
hope that I'll never change, because I want to keep on
writing until we'll have no more countries to write about&mdash;unless,
of course, some one discovers a new country.</p>

<p>Even if a new country isn't discovered, we'll find foreign
children to talk about&mdash;maybe the children in Mars! Who
knows? Nobody. Not even Marie&mdash;and Marie usually
knows about most things. That's the reason why, you see,
though I sign myself</p>

<h2>The Wee Scotch Piper</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE CRAIG FAMILY</h3>


<p>In the wee village of Aberfoyle,
which is in Perthshire County, Scotland,
lived Alan Craig, a shepherd.</p>

<p>The sheep of Scotland, like the bagpipes
and bluebells, are famous, and in
Aberfoyle there are many.</p>

<p>Dotted alongside the road are the
bright bluebells, lighting up in true
fairy array the darkness made by big,
shady trees.</p>

<p>Shrieking through the stillness of
a summer evening, comes the sound
of the bagpipes. This music is fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>nished
by a tattered piper marching
up and down, up and down. He hopes
that the people will throw pennies for
the love of the tune he plays.</p>

<p>And the sheep, like little dots of
white in the green meadows, graze.
But sometimes, they, too, shriek when
they are herded together, perhaps for
the clipping.</p>

<p>When the sheep all bleat together,
it sounds very much like the shrieking
of the bagpipes. Maybe that is how
the bagpipe was really started. Perhaps
the sound was first uttered by a
herd of Scotch sheep!</p>

<p>It was not yet clipping time on the
small farm of Alan Craig. His sheep
still roamed the hills. Their heavy, curly wool weighed them down and
made them look as if they had on
long, woollen nighties.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The babies sometimes walked right
under their mothers, and then they
were completely hidden.</p>
<div class="figcenter" >

<span class="caption">SCOTLAND&nbsp;IS&nbsp;FULL&nbsp;OF&nbsp;SHEEP</span>
</div>
<p>On a hill sat Alan Craig, and by his
side his faithful dog, Roy. Roy was a
real sheep dog and was proud of his
profession.</p>

<p>You know, when people are called
professionals, it means that they are
trained in one occupation. Of course,
people make money at their professions,
and this was the only difference
between Roy and a professional human.</p>

<p>Roy was a professional sheep dog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
but he did his work out of devotion to
his master. Also he did it because it
was in his blood to love to race the
timid sheep over the hills and obey his
master's commands.</p>

<p>"Back, Roy!" shouted Alan Craig.</p>

<p>Roy jumped to his feet and, barking,
ran to bring back the flock, which
had disappeared around a rocky
mountain.</p>

<p>"Bowwow-wow!" The sheep heard
him coming and, stupid creatures that
they are, started to run the other way.
"Bowwow!"</p>

<p>"Down, sir, down!" came the voice
of Alan Craig from afar, and Roy understood.</p>

<p>Silently he made a dash for the lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>ing
sheep and, bounding ahead of the
herd, he stood on guard. His feet
were planted apart, and his tongue
hung out. He was barking in his own
language a short Scotch bark, which
meant, "Now, will you go back?"</p>

<p>All but the leading sheep began to
turn. That leader was, however, a
mother sheep with a loved baby. She
had always been very suspicious of
Roy.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had once snapped at her
baby, for he often had to do this to
make the sheep behave. At any rate,
the mother sheep could not forgive
him. Without any fear, she now
sprang toward Roy and butted her
head in defiance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus017.jpg" width="349" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE VILLAGE OF ABERFOYLE</p>
</div>

<p>Roy stood his ground and then made
a plunge at her legs. Meanwhile, he
let out a shrill bark as one of her sharp
horns hit his leg. It was a short but
hard battle.</p>

<p>At last Roy returned to his master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
his tongue nearly sweeping the
ground. But there was a triumphant
expression in his eyes as he drove the
crowd of panting sheep into a circle
around Alan Craig and threw himself
at his master's feet to await his reward.</p>

<p>This was not long in coming. Alan
Craig appreciated his helper. In fact
Roy was really the shepherd. Alan
had only to speak his commands&mdash;"work
his dog," as the Scotch say&mdash;and
Roy did the rest.</p>

<p>Now he stroked his dog and said,
"Good, Roy! Well done!"</p>

<p>Alan's language was well understood
by Roy, but these words would
have sounded this way to you: "Gude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Roy! Weel dune!" had Alan spoken in
the Scotch dialect to Roy.</p>

<p>He could speak very good English,
and did when he spoke to Englishmen.
But you see, Roy was a Scotchman!</p>

<p>From the little white cottage in the
hollow came the smell of dinner&mdash;fresh
pancakes and meat cooking.</p>

<p>Alan picked up his crook&mdash;the kind
that little Bopeep used&mdash;only Alan did
not look like little Bopeep. Indeed,
he was very different.</p>

<p>He was a big strong man. Although
we picture a Scotch shepherd dressed
in kilts and socks and perhaps a tam,
Alan Craig wore none of these. Kilts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and socks and tams are for the gentry,
Alan would tell you, and shepherds
are too poor to afford them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus020.jpg" width="328" height="262"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">MRS. CRAIG AND IAN&#39;S BABY SISTER AT THE VILLAGE PUMP</p>
</div>

<p>So Alan wore an old suit which
might have once been worn by your
own father and then given away to
some beggar. Alan was poor like most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of the villagers, for Scotland is rather
a poor country.</p>

<p>Still, in the little village of Aberfoyle,
everyone was happy. In the
evenings the people from the big city
of Glasgow came in big buses. They
danced outside on the village green to
the tune of the pipes, while they gloried
in the fresh country air.</p>

<p>So you must not think that Alan
Craig and his family suffered. Indeed,
there could hardly have been a happier
little family in Scotland.</p>

<p>That evening Alan wended his way
homeward and was met by his wife
and baby. If you have ever seen how
an Indian mother carries her baby,
then you will know how Mrs. Craig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
carried hers. Only instead of carrying
it on her back as the Indians do,
she carried it in front wrapped securely
in her plaid shawl.</p>

<p>Her one arm was thus free, and she
worked most of the day this way,
while knowing and feeling her little
one safe in her arms.</p>

<p>The family sat down to dinner in
their wee kitchen, for the farmers
have no such luxury as a dining room.
They started their soup, a thick broth
made of barley and vegetables of all
kinds. Mother Craig poured it out of
the big tureen.</p>

<p>Just at this time, the door burst
open, and a ruddy-faced boy of ten
years rushed into the room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus023.jpg" width="359" height="293"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">IAN CRAIG</p>
</div>

<p>"Ian Craig, do you know the hour?"
asked Mother Craig.</p>

<p>The boy stood in the doorway and
smiled at the family. He sniffed with
delight the pleasant odor coming to
him from the table.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, Mother," answered the boy.
"Well do I know."</p>

<p>Then he prepared to take his place
at the table, with a gesture of rubbing
his stomach in thinking of what
was to be put inside.</p>

<p>"What a bonny smell, Mother!" he
continued. "And surely the taste is
even bonnier!"</p>

<p>"'Tis the glib tongue you have, Ian
Craig," laughed his father. "You
could write poetry to the smell of a
good dinner! And now, what have you
to tell us to-night?"</p>

<p>Now, Ian was always full of stories
and tales of adventure. He was one
of those children to whom something
exciting is always happening.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus025.jpg" width="344" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">ALAN CRAIG, IAN, AND ROY</p>
</div>

<p>So the family were quite accustomed
to having him return home
with vivid tales. Some were strange,
some droll and, alas, some sad and
painful, told to the tune of bandages
and arnica.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, what boy is not sometimes
hurt? And Ian's accidents were few,
in comparison to his other experiences.
Surely, it is to be wondered
how, in a small, quiet town like Aberfoyle,
so many wondrous happenings
could occur.</p>

<p>Sometimes Ian was doubted, not,
however, by his parents, who knew
that their son was truthful. The
schoolmaster knew it, too, and was
proud of Ian, whose stories and poems
were the best in his class.</p>

<p>One day he was recounting to a group of spellbound school children his
experiences of the day. He was relating what wondrous happenings had
befallen him, when he was inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>rupted by a boy who shouted, "Ian Craig
is telling lies!"</p>

<p>The boy was a year older than Ian,
but he was never known to make
sport of Ian again. Nor did Ian ever
admit to his parents how it happened
that he arrived home from school that
day with a swollen eye.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>SANDY'S FIRST VISIT</h3>


<p>Aberfoyle is the center of the "Rob
Roy country." Rob Roy MacGregor
was, as every child knows, a great
Scotch warrior and represented one
of the oldest Highland clans.</p>

<p>In Aberfoyle, where Ian Craig lived,
stands the old house in which Sir Walter
Scott wrote his famous story "Rob
Roy." To-day it houses the village
minister.</p>

<p>Near by is a tumble-down thatched
cottage known as "Jean McAlpin's
Inn," where Rob Roy was wont to
rest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus029.jpg" width="352" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE &quot;ROB ROY BRIG&quot; AND THE HOUSE
WHERE WALTER SCOTT WROTE &quot;ROB ROY&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>A landmark in the village is the old
"Rob Roy Brig." Here on the old brig
(which means "bridge" in Scotch) Ian
would sit when school was out and his
chores at home were finished.</p>

<p>Something usually happened when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
he sat here, and many of his experiences
had started from this bridge.
Often, while he waited for adventure,
Ian fished from the bridge. He
brought home fine, fat morsels, for
the river Forth, which flows beneath
the bridge, is rich in fish.</p>

<p>But Ian's dearest memory was of
Sandy. The Sandy adventure had
taken place almost a year before, but
it was as vivid in Ian's mind as though
it had all occurred the day before.</p>

<p>It happened while Ian was fishing
from the brig. He heard the sound of
bagpipes&mdash;a sound that is nothing unusual
to hear in Scotland. Still it always
made Ian joyous and sad at once.
And now he turned to listen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus031.jpg" width="352" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">SANDY <span class="smcap">MacGREGOR</span></p>
</div>

<p>This playing was the loveliest he
had ever heard. Jamie Robinson
played almost every night in front of
the old hotel, and Ian loved the music.
But this playing was different. He
had always thought Jamie's playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
good, but he now wondered how he
could ever have thought so.</p>

<p>This tune was from far away, but it
carried across the meadow and along
the road. And then he saw Sandy!
Sandy was standing still in the middle
of the road while he played.</p>

<p>By his side was a handcart, and Ian
knew at once what it meant. Sandy
was a wandering piper, a man who
has no home, a gypsy. He piped for
his living and camped on the road.</p>

<p>Many pipers passed through Aberfoyle,
some with large families. In
fact, Jamie was one of them, only
Jamie did not travel. He lived in the
woods near Aberfoyle in a tent with
his wife and babies.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus033.jpg" width="341" height="270"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">GYPSIES OF THE HIGHWAY</p>
</div>

<p>But no one had ever played like this
before. Ian ran up the road. As he
approached the newcomer, he could
see that the piper was a little old man.
He had a kindly, wrinkled face, and
twinkling eyes which winked at Ian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
as the boy came closer. Then suddenly
he changed his tune.</p>

<p>"Bonny laddie, Highland laddie,"
shrieked the pipes.</p>

<p>Ian stopped in front of the piper
and thought he should cry. The music
ceased.</p>

<p>A hand was laid on Ian's shoulder,
and a voice asked, "And why, laddie,
do you stand and look with eyes so big
and sad?"</p>

<p>Ian then realized that he had been
staring as if in a trance. He brought
himself back to earth, smiled, and put
out his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir. I was only admiring
your bonny piping!"</p>

<p>"Ach!" laughed the piper. "And I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
only admiring the bonny laddie!
What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Ian Craig."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="350" height="289"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;MA NAME&#39;S SANDY!&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>"And mine's Sandy. You may call
me Sandy, though my name's really
Evert Robert MacKeith MacGregor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and my great-grandfather was a
cousin to the great Rob Roy."</p>

<p>With these words, Sandy MacGregor
put his pipes into his cart.
Then, slinging the rope over his shoulders,
he started to pull his load along,
while Ian kept step with him.</p>

<p>"And a fine village this is&mdash;the scene
of my ancestor's home! Do you live
here, my lad?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Sandy, and not far from old
Rob Roy Brig."</p>

<p>"Well, well," sighed Sandy. "And
could we bide a wee on the old brig of
my ancestor while Sandy rests?"</p>

<p>"Ay, could we," said Ian with great
delight, "and I can pull your cart for
you, Sandy, until we get there."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Gratefully the old man allowed the
boy to pull his load, while he stretched
his tired arms. He breathed in the
sweet-smelling air of the village of
his ancestor.</p>

<p>When they came to the bridge, Ian
put down the cart. He invited Sandy
to sit beside him on the wall, his usual
perch. The old man jumped up to the
boy's side, as spry as the boy himself,
and looked around.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, "and to think
'tis Sandy's first visit to the home of
his ancestor&mdash;Sandy who has been
nigh all over the land!"</p>

<p>At these words Ian's heart gave a
bound, and he said, "Have you seen
nigh all of bonny Scotland, Sandy?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, that have I, lad, and traveled
on my own two feet through it all."</p>

<p>"Sandy," said Ian wistfully, "would
you be telling me about it?"</p>

<p>"Ach, ay, laddie," smiled the old
wanderer. "That would I, for 'tis
many a fine sight these old eyes have
seen."</p>

<p>Sandy talked, and the boy listened.
The sun grew lower and lower in the
heavens. Ian Craig thought that
never before had he known an afternoon
to slip by so quickly.</p>

<p>Sandy told Ian about the time he
had visited Edinburgh, Scotland's
capital, and one of the most attractive
cities in the world.</p>

<p>He told of Princes Street, with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
sunken gardens on one side, and its
wonderful view of historic Edinburgh
Castle, its pretty shops and
stately monuments. It is considered
by many to be the most beautiful
street in all the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<p class="caption">PRINCES STREET, EDINBURGH</p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>On the top of a winding hill is Edinburgh
Castle. Here, in the courtyard
of the old castle is Half-Moon Battery,
where is kept the one-o'clock gun.</p>

<p>This gun fires every day at the hour
of one. It is attached by electric wire
to the time ball on the top of Nelson's
Monument on Carlton Hill opposite.
This ball falls, in turn, at a signal from
Greenwich Observatory, near London,
where is set the time for the whole
world.</p>

<p>In another part of the castle
grounds can be found a pathetic little
plot of ground known as "The Dogs'
Cemetery." Here are buried the pets
of the soldiers who fought in the
World War.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">THE DOGS&#39; CEMETERY</p>
</div>

<p>Many of these little beasts were
gallant heroes and were buried with
great reverence. Lovely flowers decorate
their graves, and inscriptions
tell of each one's valor.</p>

<p>But to one little dog in particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
was a fountain erected. It stands
in one of the streets of Edinburgh.
This fountain represents "Greyfriars'
Bobby," as the little dog was called.</p>

<p>He was given this name because it
was to the old Greyfriars Churchyard
that he went, day after day, to seek
his master, who was buried there. The
caretakers of the cemetery tried to
keep him out.</p>

<p>Still day after day he came. He
always lay upon the grave of his master
and grieved, until one day they
found him dead. And now the fountain
is there to remind the people of
this faithful little creature.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>PIPERS</h3>


<p>"Do you think my dog would grieve
if I should die?" asked Ian, as he
brushed away a tear with his sleeve
and tried to distract Sandy's attention
from his action.</p>

<p>"Ay, if you treat him kindly, lad,"
answered the old man. "Beasties are
faithful to us when they know we love
them."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Ian. "Roy is faithful, and
a smart sheep dog, too."</p>

<p>"Do you like fine to herd the sheep,
laddie?" asked Sandy.</p>

<p>Ian hung his head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Sandy. I like finer to go about
and have adventures and make up
that I am&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

<p>"What, lad? Speak. Do not be
afraid of Sandy for he knows the
hearts of laddies well."</p>

<p>"If I could play the pipes, Sandy, I
would go away and be a piper in the
band some day," confessed Ian.</p>

<p>This was, indeed, a dream so near to
his heart that he had never before
spoken it aloud. After the admission,
Ian turned his head away and did not
look at Sandy. But the old man's voice
was very soft and his tone caressing,
as he said, "And a fine dream it is, Ian
lad, for to be a piper is a great and
honored calling."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay," answered Ian huskily, "but
'tis not for me, Sandy."</p>

<p>Sandy turned the boy around then
and looked him squarely in the eye.</p>

<p>"Ian, lad, do not speak so, for nothing
is too hard to get when you want
it."</p>

<p>Ian's eyes lighted up for a moment.
Then the same forlorn look came into
them as he let his head droop.</p>

<p>"No, Sandy. The pipes are too dear,
and it takes many months to learn to
play."</p>

<p>"And you study hard at school,
lad?" asked the piper.</p>

<p>"Ay, do I," spoke the boy.</p>

<p>"Then some day, you'll be liking to
hear of the fine military school I saw."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<p class="caption">THE PIPER LADDIES</p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ach, Sandy, tell me about it. Have
you really seen it?" Ian was at once
alert.</p>

<p>"Ay, that have I, and only three
weeks ago when I was passing by
Dunblane."</p>

<p>As the poor little village lad drank
in his words, Sandy talked on about
the wonderful school in Dunblane.
This school is called the Queen Victoria
School. Here lads between the
ages of nine and fifteen are trained as
soldiers.</p>

<p>They are sons of military men, some
of whom fell in the World War. These
boys are reared and taught free of
charge. It is a great and good school
for a boy to attend.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus049.jpg" width="349" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE DRUM MAJOR</p>
</div>

<p>To see and hear these sons of Scotland's
heroes is an experience never
to be forgotten. They present a fine
appearance in their bright-colored
kilts and military trappings, as they
march and play upon their pipes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandy saw and heard, and carried
away with him a memory of the loveliest
sight and sound imaginable.
Coming toward him were boys. Children
they were, with their kilts making
a vivid pattern.</p>

<p>Their bare knees moved in perfect
unison as they stepped to the tunes of
Scotland's patriotic melodies. They
played in a way unsurpassed by pipers
older and more experienced than they.</p>

<p>First came a waltz, gracefully
played and gracefully stepped. Then
came a march, loud, fast, but always
in perfect harmony. The sound might
have come from a single organ played,
perhaps, by Scottish cherubim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>The drum major wore a plumed helmet
 and carried a baton. He was only
fourteen years old, but he twirled his
stick and marched like a veteran of
many wars.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus051.jpg" width="353" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE DRUMMER BOY</p>
</div>

<p>The little twelve-year-old drummer
swung his drumsticks into the air and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
caught them again. He never missed
a beat on his drum. The rest, pipers
all, marched and played. Their cheeks
puffed in and out, while their fingers
moved and made melodies.</p>

<p>Throughout the hills echoed the
sound. It was the same as echoed
during the Battle of Bannockburn,
when Scottish history was made. To
these tunes, in this same rugged country
marched, years ago, these lads'
ancestors.</p>

<p>And Sandy carried his memories of
Queen Victoria School back to Ian
Craig. Ian's longing to become a piper
grew greater as he listened. In his
heart he uttered a silent prayer.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>SANDY RETURNS</h3>


<p>Though his meeting with Sandy had
happened many months before, neither
the memory of Sandy nor of the
pipers had dimmed in Ian's mind.
Through his hours of work and play
his thoughts turned to marching Highland
laddies and shrieking pipes.</p>

<p>He would often imagine himself as
one of their number. Indeed, often
on his walks to school he would "make
believe," as so many children call it.
People would turn to see why the little
boy in kilts marched so straight
and puffed his cheeks out.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Ian wore kilts, though his father
did not. Many of the children went
to school in their kilts. Yet many
could not afford to do this and wore
them only on Sundays.</p>

<p>Ian, however, had a school kilt and a
Sunday kilt and was very proud of
his wardrobe. One of the main reasons
for his pride lay in the fact that
in kilts he could better imagine himself
a piper.</p>

<p>Marching alone one morning, he met
Elsie. Elsie was only a wee lass, far
younger than Ian. But she liked the
tall boy who always smiled at her and
who walked so straight.</p>

<p>Ian liked Elsie better than the other
lassies, who did not understand, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Elsie did, the importance and grandeur
of pipers. Besides, the others
were either too freckled, or their
cheeks too red.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus055.jpg" width="362" height="289"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">IAN&#39;S SCHOOL</p>
</div>

<p>Some Scotch children have the complexions
of bright sunsets. Ian liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Elsie's bonny face, with the few little
freckles on her nose, and her sunny
smile.</p>

<p>This morning Elsie overtook him as
he was marching to his own silent
drone of pipes.</p>

<p>"Do not march so, Ian. The children
will be laughing at you when you
reach the school. I heard them saying
you're daft about pipers, and I
thought I'd tell you," she said.</p>

<p>Ian looked down into the little
maiden's blue eyes. She, too, was
dressed in a kilt. She wore over it a
red jersey.</p>

<p>Unlike Ian, she did not have the
sporran. That is what the Scotch call
the piece of fur hanging down in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of the kilt. Each child's kilt was, however,
pinned on the side with a large
safety pin&mdash;which is the style in wearing
kilts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus057.jpg" width="281" height="222"  alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">KILTED SCHOOL CHILDREN</p>
</div>

<p>Elsie's hair was done in two braids,
which hung down her back. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
he resented what she told him, Ian
thought she was very sweet. For she
looked at him in a way that made his
resentment soon fade.</p>

<p>Smiling, he said, "Thanks, Elsie. I'll
not march now."</p>

<p>Silently they walked together. Ian
was very near telling his little friend
about his dreams.</p>

<p>But while he was weighing the
probable outcome of such a move, the
school bell rang. It was half past
nine, the time that school in Scotland
starts in the springtime. Ian and
Elsie ran.</p>

<p>At one o'clock, Ian went home to his
lunch. Elsie stayed, for her home
was far away. She brought her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"piece," which is what the Scotch children
call their lunch. No doubt the
word refers to their piece of bread,
which, with an apple, is sometimes all
they get.</p>

<p>At home, Ian's mother always had
waiting for him a plate of Scotch
broth, potatoes, and sometimes an
apple tart. After school Ian was
drawn to the bridge.</p>

<p>The work at home was not pressing
to-day. Father was away with the
sheep. Mother did not need Ian. His
heart was light as he started off for
the old brig. He walked along with
the hope of adventure, while in his
ears the imaginary sound of pipes
played.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ian, wait," called Elsie, and ran
after him.</p>

<p>Ian stopped and remembered that
he had almost told her. How could a
wee lass like that understand? No.
He would not speak. What was more,
he would not let her come along, for
he knew that was what she wanted
to do.</p>

<p>"Are you going fishing from the
brig?" asked Elsie blithely.</p>

<p>"Ay," answered Ian sulkily, as he
stepped ahead of her.</p>

<p>"May I go with you, Ian?" queried
the small girl.</p>

<p>"No, Elsie. You're too wee for fishing,
and you scare the fish."</p>

<p>Elsie's lip quivered. Ian feared she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
would cry right out on the road. Then
what would he do?</p>

<p>"Ach, don't cry, lass. Run home to
your mother, for 'tis late for you to
be out, and she'll be worried."</p>

<p>It was all said kindly but much too
eagerly. Elsie, who was keen, did not
doubt for a moment that she was not
wanted.</p>

<p>She ran off, while Ian, with a sigh&mdash;sad
to say, of relief&mdash;ran to his home.
He kissed his mother, took down his
fishing rod, and was off for fish and
dreams.</p>

<p>At the bridge, adventure indeed
awaited him, had he but known. He
settled himself in his favorite place
and threw his line down into the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Little did he suspect what was to
happen.</p>

<p>Singing to himself, he waited. A
tug on his line! So soon? Ah, the fish
were biting well to-day. Mother would
be pleased. What a big fish and how it
pulled! Ian struggled for several
minutes, and then up came his prize.</p>

<p>But what sort of fish was this? It
looked like a fuzzy ball of brown fur.
As it came up closer, Ian saw that it
was a bear&mdash;a toy bear. It was undoubtedly
the property of a certain
Elsie Campbell!</p>

<p>"Out, you wee devil, out!" cried Ian,
standing up and looking down under
the bridge for his tormentor.</p>

<p>There she was, and her laugh was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
most annoying to Ian. He was scolding,
and at the same time trying to
undo the hook from the toy bear's fur.</p>

<p>"Come up here, you wee devil!" repeated
Ian furiously.</p>

<p>Up came the culprit. Ian had to
join in her laughter, though he shook
his finger at her the while. She sat
down beside him happily.</p>

<p>"Ian, do you believe in the devil?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Ay, do I," he answered. "'Tis yerself."</p>

<p>"No." Elsie shook her head seriously.
"Do you know, I believe 'tis
like Santa Claus. 'Tis your own
father!"</p>

<p>"Ach, Elsie," laughed Ian, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
child's idea. "You know that Santa
Claus brings you dolls and toy bears
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ian did not go on to complete the
list, for just then he heard a sound
that made his heart beat faster.
Jumping down from the wall, he
looked up the road. Coming toward
him was Sandy!</p>

<p>How Elsie ever disappeared Ian
never knew. Disappear she did
quickly. Afterwards, when Ian
thought it over, it seemed that fairies
had snatched her away.</p>

<p>Whatever happened, she was not
there when Sandy and Ian greeted
each other. It was probably her
woman's instinct, which bade her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
leave these two to their men's affairs!</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus065.jpg" width="350" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">SANDY ARRIVES</p>
</div>

<p>How happy was Ian as his kind old
friend seated himself by Ian's side
with the same boyish leap!</p>

<p>"Well, Ian, lad," said Sandy, "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
same bonny Aberfoyle, the same bonny laddie! And do you have the same
bonny dreams?"</p>

<p>"Ach, Sandy, more than ever before.
And have you traveled far since last
I saw you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that have I, and many's the
tale I'll tell you this day. But first I
must show you something."</p>

<p>Beckoning Ian to his cart, Sandy
pointed to a bundle wrapped up in his
coat.</p>

<p>Tenderly unwrapping it, the old
piper pulled out a young lamb, dirty,
thin, and bleating.</p>

<p>"'Tis a poor hurt beastie, Ian," he
said. "I found it on the road. Its
mother is dead, and it was left to die,
too. I picked it up and now cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
care for it, as I'm wandering and have
no place to keep it."</p>

<p>"Ach, Sandy, couldn't I keep the wee
beastie for you?" asked Ian eagerly.</p>

<p>Sandy stroked his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You could, laddie. But 't would be
a while till I return&mdash;maybe not till
next spring. And a lamb with no
mother is a care."</p>

<p>"Ach, Sandy," cried the boy, "let me
do it for you. I could feed it with my
wee sister's nursing bottle."</p>

<p>"Ach, ay, laddie! Your mother
would like that fine!" laughed Sandy.
"But," he continued soberly, "if you
would keep the wee creature, I could
give you something for your trouble."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Sandy. I would keep it for
you, and gladly."</p>

<p>Sandy was still dubious. He was
worried for fear the boy's father
would object to a charge of this kind.
The lamb would need tender nursing
and careful watching.</p>

<p>Sometimes small boys grow careless,
although their intentions are of
the best. Then the task falls to Father
or Mother.</p>

<p>As Sandy was revolving these
thoughts in his mind, he suddenly
had a plan.</p>

<p>"Ian," he said, "do you remember
the story I told you of the pipers at
Dunblane?"</p>

<p>"I've thought of little else, Sandy,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
replied Ian, as he stroked the lamb.
The little creature was nestling down
comfortably in Sandy's arms.</p>

<p>"Well, lad, uncover the plaid on my
cart and see what I have there."</p>

<p>Ian turned back the bit of plaid covering
the cart. Sandy used it to
protect his personal belongings.</p>

<p>"Two sets o' pipes, Sandy!" exclaimed
Ian.</p>

<p>"Ay! One was given me by a man
for a service. It is not so bonny as
mine but might do for a laddie learning
to play!"</p>

<p>"Sandy, do you mean&mdash;?" Ian cried.</p>

<p>"Ay, lad. In the spring when I return,
if this wee beastie is fine, and
you have done your duty like a true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
shepherd, then you shall have the
pipes!"</p>

<p>"Sandy, Sandy, is it true? May I be
a piper and play the pipes like the
laddies in Dunblane? Ach, Sandy!"</p>

<p>Ian was almost mad with joy. For
a moment he forgot what service he
was to render in return for this great
reward. But remembering his charge,
he carefully lifted the little lamb out
of Sandy's arms.</p>

<p>He held it tenderly in his own, and
said, "You'll find the wee beastie well
and fat when you return in the spring,
Sandy."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THROUGH SCOTLAND WITH SANDY</h3>


<p>The warm air of spring was pleasant.
The Craig family's supper was
spread out before the door of their
cottage. They ate outdoors so that
they could enjoy the beauties of the
evening.</p>

<p>It would not be dark here until very
late. Ian's father could sit before his
cottage door, reading his paper by
daylight until almost eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>Now it was only seven. Mrs. Craig
was ringing a bell, which echoed
through the hills.</p>


<p>This was the way she called her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
 and son to the evening meal.</p>

<p>Toward her came Ian, and some one
was with him. Mrs. Craig strained
her eyes to see, but she could not
make out the stranger's figure.</p>

<p>As they came closer, Ian ran toward
his mother, calling, "Mother, I've
brought Sandy to tea!"</p>

<p>The old piper politely removed his
cap and stood before Ian's mother.</p>

<p>"Your son has brought home an old
traveler, mistress," he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Craig smiled and, shaking
Sandy's hand, said, "And glad I am,
for a friend of Ian's is welcome to the
house of his mother. Sit down, sir."</p>

<p>Ian told his mother the story of the
lamb.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus073.jpg" width="347" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">BARRIE&#39;S &quot;WINDOW IN THRUMS&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>He explained how, if he performed
his task, he would by next spring be
the owner of bagpipes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Craig smiled at Sandy and said,
"You trust the laddie, sir?"</p>

<p>Sandy MacGregor replied, "Ay; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
will he not be a piper in the band one
fine day?"</p>

<p>Alan Craig and Roy soon returned,
and Sandy was introduced to them.</p>

<p>After the little repast, Ian beckoned
Sandy to him. Nodding his head toward
the hills, he said, "Come away
and tell now about your travels
through Scotland, Sandy."</p>

<p>The two sat on the hill and watched
the smoke curling up from the cottage
chimney. And while Sandy
smoked his pipe he told Ian once
more of his wondrous adventures.</p>

<p>Traveling through Scotland is like
going through many different countries.
For Scotland's beauties are
varied. Here in the hollow is a lovely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
quaint village. Its thatched roofs and
white walled cottages make a picture
sweet to behold.</p>

<p>As you go along, soon you pass the
peaceful, hilly country and come to
rocky, steep, and rugged land. You
might be in the mountains, for it is
wild and desolate except for the
sheep, which are everywhere.</p>

<p>Around a corner, another village
looms into space. This one is cold and
bleak. You pass through it without
sight or sound of human beings. Its
buildings are tall, stony, and gray. In
the center is a pump, where the people
come to draw their water, but no
one is about.</p>

<p>With a shiver you pass on. As you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
gradually leave the village behind,
you find yourself again in pastoral
land. Thatched cottages come into
view. Bluebells begin to dot the road.
How sweet is the smell of hay and
cows and clover!</p>

<p>Once more a village, and now you
wonder whether this can be the same
country. For in the narrow streets
are children, dogs, women, peasants,
bicyclists, and more children.</p>

<p>Little girls walk along knitting.
Everyone is walking in the middle of
the cobbled street. Sandy has difficulty
in going through the crowd with
his cart.</p>

<p>This is Kurrimuir, better known as
Thrums. It is the scene of many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
J. M. Barrie's delightful stories. Here
on the corner is the dear little cottage
made famous by Barrie's "A Window
in Thrums."</p>

<p class="caption">BOYS PLAY CRICKET IN SCOTLAND</p>
</div>

<p>Passing a field, Sandy stops to
watch some boys playing cricket. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
game is very popular in Scotland. All
the boys play it, just as American
boys play baseball.</p>

<p>Doune Castle! Sandy climbs over
the fence and starts up toward the
towering mass of rock. He thinks of
the many battles fought around this
ancient stronghold. It was here that
King Robert Bruce made some of
Scotland's history.</p>

<p>Stirling Castle! Another massive
stone memorial of the days of Scotland's
stormy wars.</p>

<p>Sandy passes on until he comes to
the city of Perth. Here he stops before
the old, old house in which lived
"The Fair Maid of Perth," made famous
by Sir Walter Scott.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<p class="caption">DOUNE CASTLE</p>
</div>

<p>In St. Andrews is the oldest golf
links in the world. From everywhere
people come to play the royal and
ancient game. It is said that no course
is at all like the old course at St. Andrews.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>As you perhaps know, golf originated
in Scotland. St. Andrews is the
place where it started. Some say that
it was first begun by the shepherds. It
is thought that they used to knock
small stones with their crooks as they
strolled behind their sheep.</p>

<p>On went Sandy to Melrose. He
passed the Eildon Hills where King
Arthur and his knights are supposed
to be buried. This is the spot where,
'tis said, Sir Walter Scott used to stop
his horses every day.</p>

<p>He paused here because he loved to
look at the glorious view behind. His
horses knew the spot so well that they
would stop here of their own accord.
On the day of Sir Walter's funeral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
when they were taking his body to the
Abbey, the horses stopped once more.</p>

<p>In Alloway is the house where the
great Scotch poet, Robert Burns,
lived. Every day it is shown to hundreds
of visitors, who pay to go in and
look at the curious old place.</p>

<p>Its quaint furniture and interesting
manuscripts and pictures are all connected
with the beloved poet. In the
gardens are statues representing
many of the characters in Burns'
poems. "Poosie Nancy," "Tam O'
Shanter," and many others are there.</p>

<p>Another town made famous by a
Scottish character is Maxwelltown, or
Maxwelton, where Annie Laurie lived.</p>

<p>Passing an ancient graveyard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Sandy stops to marvel at some huge
slabs of iron. These are still kept to
show how, in the seventeenth century,
the dead were held down in their
graves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus082.jpg" width="358" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE HOME OF &quot;THE FAIR MAID OF PERTH&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>These heavy slabs were put on top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of the dead. This was done to keep
them from being dug up by robbers.
The thieves would steal and sell them
to doctors and medical students.</p>

<p>The signing of the Covenant was to
Scotland what the signing of the Declaration
of Independence was to
America. It was the beginning of
freedom!</p>

<p>James VI of Scotland tried to force
the people into his own religious beliefs.
They refused to be led. On the
first day of March, 1768, in the Old
Greyfriars Churchyard, the Covenant
was signed.</p>

<p>The signing was done on a flat
gravestone, which is there to this day.
And so, just as America has a Liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Bell, Scotland has a Liberty Stone.</p>

<p>As Sandy's old handcart rattles
through each little Scottish town, he
is impressed with the many bookshops
he sees in his country. The
Scotch are enthusiastic readers. Their
love and desire for education are national
traits.</p>

<p>Often Sandy passes young boys or
young girls sitting by the roadside,
absorbed in their books. The colleges
and schools of Scotland are fine indeed.</p>

<p>When Sandy asks a direction, he is
sure to receive a courteous reply. The
children who come to his side are
polite and kind and anxious to help.
They will gladly do what they can for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
a stranger and do not ask any pay in
return.</p>

<p>Over many stores and buildings
Sandy reads names which start with
"Mac," such as MacNiel and MacKenzie.
He smiles as he thinks about
these names. He knows that these
people, like himself, are the descendants
of the old clan leaders.</p>

<p>They gave the name "Mac," which
means "son of," to their children. So,
if a clan leader was named Gregor,
the children of his clan would be MacGregor.
In the olden days, the word
"clan," which comes from an old Gaelic
word meaning "children," was like a
great family. Their chief was like a
father, whom they all obeyed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>To-day, you no doubt know people
named MacDonald, MacRae, etc.
These are the descendants of the
"clansmen," as they were called.</p>

<p>Each clan has a tartan of its own. A
tartan is what you would probably
call plaid. It is the heathery mixture
of many colors and designs.</p>

<p>Each tartan is different from every
other. To-day in Scotland you will see
the children wearing kilts or ties or
tams made of their own family tartan.</p>

<p>The town of Paisley is famous for
its Paisley shawls. These are very
much admired by all the world and
worn by ladies of fashion.</p>

<p>The Shetland shawls, also famous,
are dear to old ladies, because they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
are soft and warm. The Shetland
ponies are dear to children, for they
are so little that they are more like
large dogs than like horses. Both
come from the Shetland Islands, which
are north of Scotland and are ruggedly
wild.</p>

<p>Through all of Sandy's travels he
never saw the thistle, which is supposed
to grow so thickly in Scotland.
The thistle, as you perhaps know, is
used on Scottish crests and banners.
No doubt it existed, long ago, but to-day
it is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Here is Loch Drunkie, a queer name
with a queer history. It was on the
shores of this lake that men made
whisky&mdash;which was against the law.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>One day the men saw officers of the
law coming toward them. They knew
that they would be arrested if they
were found out. To avoid arrest, they
emptied their whisky into the lake.
People say that the waters have remained
half whisky from that day to
this.</p>

<p>Sandy jogs along toward Aberfoyle.
It is the day he delivers his injured
lamb to the mercies of his young
friend. During this time, he passes
another "loch," the well known and
much beloved "Loch Lomond."</p>

<p>Sandy stops on the shore. He gazes
below on the shining blue waters, upon
which ply the tiny white steamers.
He shoulders his bagpipes and plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the melody known in every clime, "On
the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond."
Here the fairies were wont
to dwell. A tale is told of fairy dyers,
who worked for the clans of Loch
Lomond in the days of yore.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus089.jpg" width="343" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;ON THE BONNY, BONNY BANKS OF LOCH LOMOND&quot;</p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>A joke was once played upon the
wee elfin folk by a boy. The lad asked
to have the fleece of a black sheep
dyed white. Angered by this request,
the fairies overturned their pots of
dye into the lake and never more returned.</p>

<p>But the color from their dye turned
the lake an unearthly shade of blue.
This color is different from that of all
other lakes, and thus it has remained.</p>

<p>Again Sandy pipes:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>IAN'S BETTY</h3>


<p>For many weeks after Sandy's departure
from Aberfoyle, Ian tended
the lamb carefully. He fed it from a
baby's bottle. The young creature
grew strong and fat. It would follow
the boy around as though it knew him
to be its nurse.</p>

<p>It was a loving little animal, and Ian
became very fond of it. He would
take it with him when he sat with his
father upon the hill where Roy
guarded the other sheep.</p>

<p>It did not mingle with the others,
for it was an orphan. It knew that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
did not belong with the flock. Sheep
are not like people. Human beings,
seeing a motherless child, would
strive to protect it with their own
young ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus092.jpg" width="336" height="262"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">IAN FED BETTY FROM A NURSING BOTTLE</p>
</div>

<p>So the task of protector and nurse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
fell to Ian. He loved to feel the wee
one's soft fur against his cheek as it
lay on the hill with him. He liked to
feed it from its bottle and hear the
soft, gurgling noises it made.</p>

<p>It amused him to see its tail waggled
so rapidly after each mouthful
of milk. This is the way it showed
Ian how well it liked its dinner. And
as Ian felt the lamb, warm and soft in
his arms, he seemed to feel there something
else&mdash;his beloved bagpipes!</p>

<p>Much to the amusement of his parents,
Ian called the lamb Betty, his
baby sister's name. He felt that it
was as helpless and young as she.</p>

<p>Very often they both sucked from
their nursing bottles at the same time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
While they were doing this, they
looked at each other with big, wondering
eyes. Ian often sat and admired
the pair and laughingly said to
his mother, "Your baby and my baby,
Mother."</p>

<p>So the days flew by, and the summer
wore on. Soon the school bell began
to ring out again. It told the children
that another term was beginning.</p>

<p>Ian was loth to leave his happy pastimes
in field and on hill. However,
he, like all Scotch children, was
anxious to learn. So one morning, he
strapped his book bag on his back and
started off to school.</p>

<p>That was a lonely day for the lamb
Betty. She was lonely because her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
young guardian had hardly ever left
her side. The lamb was clearly worried
and bleated unmercifully until
Ian returned from school.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus095.jpg" width="340" height="262"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">IAN HOME FROM SCHOOL</p>
</div>

<p>When, the next day, the same thing
happened, Ian's pet could stand it no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
longer and started out to find him.</p>

<p>Every child in the world knows the
song about "Mary's little lamb." That
day, as Betty marched herself up the
steps of Ian's schoolhouse, a chorus of
childish voices sang out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Ian had a wee, wee lamb;</div>
        <div class="verse">It followed him to school!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There was much merriment as Ian
hurriedly packed Betty off to her
home. Like the teacher in the song,
this teacher had difficulty in restoring
order.</p>

<p>It was also a flushed and embarrassed
Ian who returned to his classroom.
That evening he lectured Betty
upon behavior for lambs!</p>

<p>However, Betty was either disobedient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
or else too young to understand
Ian's lecture. The next day she tried
to repeat her performance. She
started off on a gallop to find her
young master. I say, "tried," for alas,
this time poor Betty could not find
Ian's school!</p>

<p>For many hours she wandered
about. She went farther and farther,
not only from school but from home.
Evening fell, and Betty was bleating
alone in a dense forest&mdash;lost!</p>

<p>At last Ian returned from school.
For several moments, he could not
understand why Betty did not come
to meet him. He stood and gazed
about. Then a terrible thought came
to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus098.jpg" width="355" height="274"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">LOST!</p>
</div>

<p>Rushing to his father on the hillside,
he asked excitedly for his pet. Alan
Craig shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"I've sent Roy again, laddie, but
he's returned once alone. I fear the
beastie is lost."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Lost! Ian's world fell about him.
The sound of distant bagpipes seemed
to resound dully in his ears. The
words of Sandy came to him through
the dim: "In the spring, if this beastie
is fine, and you have done your
duty&mdash;"</p>

<p>His duty! And poor Betty! Where
could she be? A little lonely creature,
more baby than animal, tended so
carefully, and unused to the thorns
and sharp rocks of the hills&mdash;alone
and lost!</p>

<p>"Father!" was all that Ian could
gasp. Just then he saw Roy coming
toward them, his tail between his legs.
An expression of failure was in his
shepherd eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Roy, lad, can you not find her?"
asked Ian.</p>

<p>Ian threw his school books off his
back. Kneeling, he put his arms
around the neck of Roy. Roy answered
in his own way. It was as clear to Ian
as though the dog had cried out to
him, "No, laddie, she's lost, lost!"</p>

<p>And if a sheep was lost to Roy, it
was indeed a lost sheep! For the
clever dog would smell a sheep for
many miles. He would, in fact, encounter
any danger to bring a straggler
back to the fold.</p>

<p>Still, thought Ian, Betty was not
really one of the fold. It was possible
that Roy's experience did not fit him
to scent out tame pets.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to look, Father," shouted
the heartbroken boy.</p>

<p>Calling Roy, he started off on a run.
The father shook his head and felt a
great pity for his little son.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>ALAN CRAIG TELLS A STORY</h3>


<p>The word "Betty" resounded in the
hills many times that evening. The
lights in the village were already
lighted when a tired, heartsick boy,
followed by a sympathetic sheep dog,
returned to the Craig cottage.</p>

<p>There they were awaited by Alan
Craig. The lad stumbled blindly into
the house.</p>

<p>He found his father with a candle in
his hand, waiting to lead the disappointed
boy to his bed.</p>

<p>Ian cried himself to sleep that night.
Roy, the dog, sat beside him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
mourned for the lost member of the
little household.</p>

<p>The next day and the next were
spent in searching the hills, the fields,
and the forest. Fortunately for Ian,
they were Saturday and Sunday, and
he did not have to go to school.</p>

<p>He arose before the dawn and did
not return until evening. But it was
always the same. Betty was nowhere
to be found. Though Ian and Roy
hunted in every conceivable place, the
lamb had disappeared.</p>

<p>On Monday, Ian was forced to relinquish
his hunt and go to school. Immediately
after school he called to
Roy and was off again.</p>

<p>"The lad hardly eats his meals, he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
so troubled!" said Mrs. Craig to her
husband, as she shook her head.</p>

<p>Alan bit his pipe in silence, while
his heart bled for Ian.</p>

<p>Alan had been training a new dog
for the sheep. He was using this dog
instead of Roy, who was allowed to
stay with Ian and help him in his
search.</p>

<p>But this meant added work for
Alan, who had to be on the watch. He
could not leave his charges completely
in the care of this new helper,
as he had done with Roy. Many times
the new dog frightened the sheep.
They soon became panicky and ran
in all directions.</p>

<p>Then the dog forgot all of Alan's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
training and ran after them wildly.
Alan always had to come himself to
restore order.</p>

<p>One day he tramped miles to recover
a terrified mother and her baby.
After this long walk, Alan sat on the
hillside.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the new dog looked at
him out of the corner of his eye, and
dropped his tail because he was
ashamed.</p>

<p>As the shepherd sat smoking, he
saw his son coming toward him, followed
by Roy. Ian threw himself
down beside his father. Letting his
head sink upon the shepherd's knee,
he gave up the search.</p>

<p>"'Tis weary I am, Father," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
sighed. "The search is over, and my
wee lamb is gone."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus106.jpg" width="333" height="263"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">IAN GIVES UP THE SEARCH</p>
</div>

<p>"And your pipes, Ian? Are they to
be lost, too?" queried the shepherd.</p>

<p>"Ay," answered his son, "for Sandy
said, 'If you tend the wee creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
well till spring!' Now Sandy will return
in the spring, and there'll be no
creature."</p>

<p>For a few moments Alan Craig
smoothed Ian's curly black hair. The
boy tried hard to hold back his sobs,
which were nearly choking him.</p>

<p>Then Alan Craig spoke. "Ian, lad,
have you not heard the story of Bruce
and the spider?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Father," replied Ian. "'Tis in
my history book."</p>

<p>"Then mind well while I repeat it to
you. For King Robert Bruce was a
great man, and he never gave up!"</p>

<p>Ian listened intently while his father
recounted the well-known tale. He
told how, many, many years ago, King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Robert Bruce had fought with the
English and lost numerous battles.
One night, he was lying despondent on
a rude couch in his tent on the battlefield.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus108.jpg" width="358" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">KING BRUCE AND THE SPIDER</p>
</div>

<p>His heart was heavy with the memory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of his lost battles and of the suffering
throughout his country. Just
then his eye fell upon a spider in the
corner of the tent. The industrious
little creature was trying to fix its
web to the top pole of the tent. It had
already made six attempts, but each
time it had fallen.</p>

<p>King Bruce bethought him of his
lost battles. Six! He and the spider
had failed six times. And now he,
King Bruce, was about to give up!
Would the spider also be downed, or
would it, perhaps, persevere once
more?</p>

<p>King Bruce made a vow to himself.
He decided that, should the wee creature
try again to fix its web and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
successful, then he, Robert Bruce,
would profit by the spider's lesson and
fight another battle!</p>

<p>The spider made another attempt.
Slowly it raised its shadowy body
until, quivering in the air, it balanced
itself for the final plunge. The King
raised himself on his elbow and
watched. A nation awaited that
spider's success or failure!</p>

<p>Again it plunged, caught at the
pole, and fixed its web! King Robert
Bruce jumped to his feet. He threw
his plaid about him and began his
preparations for the greatest battle
in Scottish history, the Battle of Bannockburn.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, he routed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
English at this famous battle. Never
afterward would the great King give
up!</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus111.jpg" width="353" height="281"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">ALAN TELLS THE STORY OF KING BRUCE AND THE SPIDER</p>
</div>

<p>"So should we all feel, Ian," said
Alan Craig as he finished his tale.</p>

<p>"From the King to the spider!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Though Ian had heard the story often
before, it now held a new meaning for
him. He looked up at his father.</p>

<p>Then he stood erect and called to
his dog, "Come, Roy; we'll try again!"</p>

<p>He was soon off through the hills
once more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>PIPERS AND TROUBLES</h3>


<p>At the beginning of that same summer,
Jamie Robinson, Aberfoyle's
piper, became restless. Jamie was
not a steady man. He had never been
a good provider. His poor wife and
babies were often hungry and cold in
the stormy winter months.</p>

<p>Jamie Robinson earned his living by
his piping. He marched back and
forth through the village street, playing
his bagpipes. He hoped that the
noisy, celebrating crowds, which arrived
from Glasgow, would like his
music and throw him pennies.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>When the people were generous, his
family might have a good dinner. But
often Jamie Robinson did not bring
the money home to his family. Unfortunately
Jamie, who was a weak man,
was often led by some of the village
men into public houses. Here men
gamble and drink.</p>

<p>Sometimes poor Mrs. Robinson
waited until very late for her husband
to come home. When at last he
arrived, he came penniless.</p>

<p>But now Jamie was buoyed up by
the balmy weather. He felt a longing
for the open road.</p>

<p>"Come away, wife," he pleaded.
"'Tis no living for a man here."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Robinson only shook her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
head and reminded him of their large
family and of the hardships of a wandering
life. After all, they were comfortable
here, when Jamie brought
home the pennies.</p>

<p>They had a little corner on a bright
meadow beside a brook. Besides,
the people of Aberfoyle were kind.
Mrs. Robinson tried to keep her four
wee children clean and happy. But
this task was not always easy. What
would it be on the open road?</p>

<p>"No, Jamie," she said. "'Tis afraid
I am to go traveling with the wee
bairns." (Children are called bairns
in Scotland.)</p>

<p>But Jamie insisted and promised
that she would not regret it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
promised that he would make money
and provide for them better than
before.</p>

<p>And so, one day the village of Aberfoyle
said good-bye to Piper Robinson.
The little caravan then moved
on to what they hoped would be a better
life.</p>

<p>They made a queer picture as they
trudged along. There was Jamie pulling
the cart, with Mrs. Robinson beside
him. Her entire kitchen was
strung upon her back&mdash;teakettle,
sauce pan, and soup ladle.</p>

<p>Then came the oldest child, followed
by the scrawny dog. Behind
him dragged a freckled boy of five
years. In the handcart, on top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
sticks and the tent, sat the two babies.
One of them was three and the other
barely two years old.</p>

<p>For some time Jamie Robinson was
happy. In each little village where
he played, he made enough to feed his
family. He tried to please his wife
and brought home all the money that
was thrown him.</p>

<p>But the weeks wore on, and the
family moved farther and farther
from the big cities. Then it seemed
that there became less and less money
for pipers.</p>

<p>One night Jamie came back to his
little brood with empty pockets. The
rain had been falling all day. The
family of Jamie Robinson had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
huddled together in their tent like
lost sheep. When Jamie entered the
tent, the baby was crying. Jamie
knew she was hungry.</p>

<p>While Sandy MacGregor traveled,
he usually sang or whistled. Sandy
was always happy. He was getting
old, and his stride was not what it had
been. Still he gloried in his happy-go-lucky
life.</p>

<p>Since leaving Aberfoyle, Sandy had
thought often of the little boy in
whose charge he had left the baby
lamb. Old Sandy chuckled to himself
when he thought about his return and
Ian's joy upon receiving the bagpipes.</p>

<p>"If I could only stay and teach the
laddie to play!" mused the old piper.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandy was a good piper and had
once served in the army. Jamie Robinson
had only picked up a few tunes.
Ian had recognized Sandy's clever
playing at once on the day he had first
come to Aberfoyle.</p>

<p>Now, wet from the showers and
hungry, Sandy stopped in a town.
Taking out his pipes, he began to play.
It was the same town where Jamie
Robinson had played that night and
the night before. The people were
poor.</p>

<p>The rain had been falling in steady
showers, so that few persons were
about the streets. Sandy puffed on
his pipes, and the sweet melody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
echoed through the village and beyond
to the hills. But not a soul came
to pay the piper.</p>

<p>"Ach, well," sighed Sandy. He
wiped the dripping water from his
brow and put back the pipes. He covered
them carefully with his plaid.
Then pulling his cart, the old man
moved on through the wet streets of
the village. Soon he was on the open
road.</p>

<p>His experienced eyes fell upon a
camping spot. He decided to rest the
night there. He neared the little
clump of trees by the side of the road.
Then he saw that he was not the only
traveler who had chosen this spot.
Here was the tent of Jamie Robinson.</p>

<p>As Sandy drew closer, he heard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
baby crying. Sandy called out, and
Jamie put his face out of his tent. A
sullen, angry face it was.</p>

<p>"And what is it you want?" he bellowed.</p>

<p>Sandy walked up to the man and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Ach, don't be angry," he said. "I'll
not be harming you. I'm an old piper
and would rest the night here beside
you, if you have no objection."</p>

<p>Jamie looked at the cart and again
at Sandy's happy red face.</p>

<p>Then, softening his tone, he said,
"Then welcome. And have you piped
to yon village?"</p>

<p>"Ay," answered Sandy, "but they
have not cared for my music!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>He laughed as he said this, and
started to pitch his tent.</p>

<p>Jamie came out and helped him. It
was not long before he had told Sandy
all of his troubles. Sandy's brows
wrinkled. A sadness came over his
face as he listened to Jamie's tale of
woe.</p>

<p>The family had been stranded here
for three days. The rain had kept
them from moving. Then the wee
baby was ill, and the others were hungry
and cold. Not a penny had been
made in the town. Jamie had played
several times each day. He had even
trudged along to the next town with
no better results.</p>

<p>Sandy was shocked. The thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of hungry children tormented him.
Telling Jamie that he wished to try
his luck in the town once more, he
hastened thither, his pipes under his
arm.</p>

<p>Sandy had never been a rich man.
He always had enough to buy his
meals, and that was all. A piper cannot
make a great deal. Sandy's music
usually brought him ample money
for his needs. But he was a generous
soul and gave away half of what he
earned.</p>

<p>To-night he had in his pocket just
enough to buy his dinner. Into the
town he went. It was not long before
he returned to the suffering family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
with bread and milk. To Mrs. Robinson,
Sandy appeared as a good fairy
that night.</p>

<p>The next day broke fair. Early
Sandy was in the market square of the
town. He played the finest tunes he
knew, strutting up and down.</p>

<p>The villagers liked his music, and
the children followed him. They
would have liked to shower Sandy
with gold, for the joy that their country's
melodies brought them. But
their purses were thin. They could
only smile sadly and shake their heads
at the puffing old man.</p>

<p>There was nothing for the Robinsons
to do but to move on. It was a
difficult task for Mrs. Robinson. But
with Sandy's help, she managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
pilot her little tribe along the muddy
road to the next village.</p>

<p>For many days Sandy and the Robinsons
traveled together. Sandy piped
and gave them all he made, which was
little enough. Often he himself would
go hungry to bed.</p>

<p>It grew so bad that poor Sandy began
to wonder what would happen to
them. Not for worlds would he have
left them. Never did such a thought
enter his mind.</p>

<p>He worried more over the sick baby
than did Jamie Robinson. Jamie was,
in fact, to Sandy, another child. Sandy
felt as though he had to protect the
irresponsible piper along with his
family.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>These were terrible days for Sandy.
He sold nearly everything he had to
provide for the Robinsons and keep
them from going hungry.</p>

<p>One day the baby became desperately
ill. It needed a doctor. Sandy
rushed to the nearest village. The
doctor was brought and pronounced
the baby in a serious condition. He
said it must be given fresh milk and
nourishing food. But to provide these
things was too difficult for the little
family.</p>

<p>One thought had been at the back
of Sandy's mind all along. But he had
not allowed himself to consider it
seriously until now. This crisis, however,
forced him to carry out a plan.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>The bagpipes he had promised Ian
were the only valuable possession in
his little cart. They would bring
enough money to save the baby's life.</p>

<p>Sandy pulled them out. He polished
the silver and rubbed the chanter
carefully to remove the dust. Meanwhile,
his thoughts flew to Ian. In his
heart he was used to calling Ian "the
wee Scotch piper," for he hoped to see
the boy realize his dream some day.</p>

<p>Now the pipes would have to go.
He would have to return to the lad
empty-handed and with his promise
broken. Still, it was the only thing he
could do. So poor Sandy sold the
pipes.</p>

<p>Sandy returned from the village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
with his pockets bulging. He seemed
to see Ian in front of him, the wee
lamb in his arms. Ian seemed to be
looking expectantly and questioningly
at his old friend.</p>

<p>And Sandy heard himself saying,
"No, laddie. Sandy has disappointed
you and has not brought you the
pipes!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>IAN TRIES AGAIN</h3>


<p>Ian was once more in search of
Betty. The story of King Bruce
echoed in his ears and spurred him on.
Roy, too, seemed to be inspired with
new hope. He sniffed and ran, and ran
and sniffed. Every once in a while, he
would let out short, sharp barks.</p>

<p>"Do not weary yourself, lad," said
Ian. "We have long to go this day,
and we'll not give up."</p>

<p>With these words the boy began to
whistle. A happiness seemed to come
suddenly to him as though he already
had Betty safe in his arms.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>For many hours the boy and dog
climbed and walked. At last they
found themselves in a wild, rugged
portion of the country, where Ian had
never before been. Rocks were all
about him. He descended into giant
caverns.</p>

<p>He called, "Betty!" and received
only an echo for reply. He went farther
until it was so late that he could
not think of returning home. He
would surely lose his way in the darkness,
if he attempted it. So he curled
himself up between two massive
rocks and, with Roy nestling close to
his side, fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>At dawn, Ian was awakened by Roy.
The dog was barking and making wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
dashes in the direction of a large
gulch near by.</p>
<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus131.jpg" width="635" height="444"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">IAN, BETTY AND ROY</p>
</div>
<p>He ran madly to the gulch, then
dashed back again to Ian. His barks
came in hysterical gasps.</p>

<p>Ian ran with Roy to the edge of the
gulch. Looking down, the boy saw a
terrible sight. Hanging on to a ragged
ledge was a large mother sheep. It
was one of his own father's, as he
could see by the markings on the wool.
The poor creature was bleating. A
few feet above the ledge stood her
baby lamb.</p>

<p>At each of Roy's barks, the mother
sheep gave a little jump, and the ledge
of rock quivered. Ian thought surely
it would break and the sheep would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
be dashed to pieces on the rocks
below.</p>

<p>"Down, down!" commanded Ian in
the same voice as his father used to
the dog.</p>

<p>Roy crouched and whined, but
stopped his barking. Ian remembered
that some of the mother sheep distrusted
the dog. So it would be impossible
for Roy to show himself now.
What must be done must be done by
Ian himself.</p>

<p>While the boy climbed down the
precipitous rocks, the faithful dog,
deprived of his rightful work, whined
and howled. Had he not been trained
to obey, he would never have stayed.
But to a shepherd dog, a master's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
word is law. Roy watched his young
friend as the boy made the perilous
descent to rescue the terrified animal
on the ledge.</p>

<p>The sheep was large, and its wool
weighed heavily. But Ian grasped the
creature firmly. With all his might,
he pulled until he had it on the rock
above. When the baby lamb saw its
mother coming, it uttered loud, joyous
bleatings.</p>

<p>Ian could only think that the sheep
had been led astray by his father's
new dog. He was worried for fear
that there were others which had
strayed beyond. He decided to see,
and started off beyond the rock hill.</p>

<p>But when Roy began to drive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
mother sheep along, she became very
angry. She ran at him with her
head lowered. Roy could not manage
her. She refused to obey him and Ian.</p>

<p>The boy, who carried a crook like
his father's, was forced to resort to
the only means of bringing her to order.
With a quick sweep of the crook,
he caught the baby sheep. He lifted
it in his arms.</p>

<p>"Now, you'll come away," he said
to the mother, as he walked on. Snorting,
the mother sheep was forced to
follow.</p>

<p>On and on walked Ian and Roy. And
now the hunt was not only for Betty,
but for more of his father's herd. Ian
thought he would find some that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
might have been led astray by the
new dog.</p>

<p>At noon he sat down to eat his
"piece," which he carried in his sporran.
When he had finished, he started
for a clear stream near by.</p>

<p>As he approached, he thought he
saw one of the grayish rocks in the
stream moving. He rubbed his eyes.
Could it be a reflection from the
water? No. It was moving slowly.</p>

<p>Ian approached faster. What was
his amazement at finding the gray
rock to be his own Betty! It was his
Betty, thin and ragged, and stumbling
along on her front knees, too weak to
raise her feet. Poor little beast!</p>

<p>She was nearly dead. As Ian raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
her up, he realized that he had found
her just in time. The creature seemed
to know the boy, for she nestled down
in his arms as of yore. In spite of her
suffering, she seemed perfectly happy,
now that her Ian was found.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>SPRING</h3>


<p>Spring! Each day found an eager,
watchful boy, a happy, sweet-faced
sheep dog, and a large fleecy lamb
standing on the Rob Roy Brig. They
were awaiting in glad anticipation a
visitor, who was expected and whose
music would soon reach the happy
ears of a future piper.</p>

<p>Ian Craig had never allowed his
Betty to roam after that frightful episode.
She had been kept in a little
corral, which Ian built for her. When
he came home from school, he took
her with him to the brig. He fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
her to a massive rock, while he
awaited the return of Sandy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus139.jpg" width="361" height="262"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">BETTY AWAITS SANDY&#39;S RETURN</p>
</div>

<p>Betty was now almost as fat and
big as the other sheep. She was a
credit to the boy's good care. So
proud of her was Ian that he often
tied a lovely tartan ribbon about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
neck. He combed her wool tenderly
each day before he started off for the
brig.</p>

<p>Day after day, the two waited.
Meanwhile, Roy looked on with kindly
eyes, although he did not understand
it all. Of course, Betty was equally
ignorant of why she was made to pose
with a floppy bow around her neck,
tied to an annoying rock. But she
was content, for Ian stayed beside
her.</p>

<p>Sometimes as Ian watched and
waited, he thought he heard the bagpipes
in the distance. And as he heard,
his heart beat faster. The moment of
bliss when he could claim his reward,
seemed to be upon him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he often looked at Betty, and
a qualm seized him. How could he
part with the lamb? He had been
through trouble and sorrow for the
little animal. He had lived many
happy hours by her side. It was as
though she had become his own. The
thought of parting from her was like
a stab. Then, too, Betty loved him.</p>

<p>At these times, the poor little boy
would knit his brow and ponder upon
the strangeness of life.</p>

<p>Then he thought of the pipers and
the tale of Dunblane, where the stalwart
lads marched and played. He
thought of the glorious piper bands
marching in the big towns. The
thought made him brighten and jump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
from the brig and scan the country
for a sign of Sandy.</p>

<p>But the days of budding blossoms
and showers in Scotland wore on.
Finally Betty's ribbon bow began to
fade and Ian's patience to wear.</p>

<p>Little Elsie Campbell used at times
to walk with the boy to the brig.
Often he stopped on the walk and
talked to her, as he cocked his head on
one side.</p>

<p>"Do you not hear the din of pipes,
Elsie?" he asked.</p>

<p>And the wee lassie shook her head
and said, "Ach, no, lad. 'Tis daft you
are with your pipes!"</p>

<p>But it was said kindly, for Elsie
hoped and prayed that Sandy would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
return. You see, Ian had told her the
story of Betty and how he waited for
the promised pipes. It was, in fact,
Elsie who had first tied the silken tartan
ribbon about the lamb's neck.</p>

<p>It was a gray day which promised
rain. Ian and Betty neared the brig
together. Ian had just tied the creature
to her accustomed rock and was
lifting himself to the wall when he
heard a sound. Pipes! Unmistakably
pipes!</p>

<p>Still, he had been mistaken so often
before that he dared not look. And
Elsie was not there to-day. She would
have told him. For in her ears the
sound was not always droning as it
had been in Ian's for many days.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not told his mother for fear
of worrying her. But his head was
often heavy, and he could not sleep
with the sound of the bagpipes. Poor
little Ian! If only Sandy would return!</p>

<p>On this dull, misty day as he swung
his feet from the wall of the brig, Ian
could not stop the sound. Nearer and
nearer it came!</p>

<p>Then, "Bonny laddie, Highland laddie,"
chanted the pipes. Ian looked up
and saw standing before him his
Sandy!</p>

<p>Although he was as red and wrinkled
and twinkling as before, there was a
change. Sandy was very shabby. His
coat was stained with the mud and
rain of many hard days.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped his playing and stood
before the boy. A sad, longing look
came into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ian, lad," he said slowly, "'tis
Sandy come back."</p>

<p>And Ian suddenly realized that it
was all true and not one of his dreams.
He jumped down from the wall and
threw his arms about Sandy.</p>

<p>"Ach, Sandy," he cried. Then he
stood back and pointed to the lamb.
Evidently Sandy had not noticed it.</p>

<p>"And do you not see our beastie,
Sandy? 'Tis the same you left with
me, and well and fat she is."</p>

<p>Sandy turned and looked at Betty.
But he did not talk as Ian had expected
him to, nor did he compliment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Ian on the lamb's well-being. He only
stood fingering his pipes and slowly
shaking his head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus146.jpg" width="633" height="444"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;SANDY HIMSELF WILL TEACH YOU TO PLAY&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>As Ian stared in wonderment, the
piper lifted his bagpipes from his
shoulder and handed them to the boy.</p>

<p>"Your pipes are here, lad, and
Sandy keeps his promise!" he said.</p>

<p>Without thinking Ian put out his
arms to receive the instrument. His
eyes, however, did not leave his
friend's face.</p>

<p>"But, Sandy, these are your own
pipes you're giving me!" he said, as if
he could hardly believe it, after looking
down at what Sandy had placed in
his arms.</p>

<p>"Ay, lad," answered Sandy, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
now you can be a fine piper, and Sandy
himself will teach you to play."</p>

<p>Then Sandy told Ian the sad story
of Jamie Robinson. He explained
how he had sold nearly all his worldly
goods to help the little family and put
them on their feet again. He told of
how he had left them comfortably
settled near a prosperous village. He
had made Jamie promise to work and
save for his little brood.</p>

<p>Sandy also told how he had come
all the way to keep his promise to
the boy. He said, too, that now, as
in Aberfoyle there was no piper, he
expected to stay here and take Jamie
Robinson's place if Ian would lend him
his pipes each day for awhile. And in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
return, he would teach the lad to
play!</p>

<p>"For I'm not so young as I was, laddie,
and the wandering life is over for
me," he added.</p>

<p>When Ian heard these plans, he was
beside himself with joy. He hugged
first Sandy, then Roy, and then Betty.
At last the piper became his old jolly
self once more and laughed.</p>

<p>"Ay, lad, we'll share the pipes together,
though they belong to you.
But old Sandy will have to make a
living, and he'll teach you all the
tunes he knows!"</p>

<p>No happier boy than Ian Craig lived
in Scotland that night. Standing before
the door of the cottage, he puffed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and blew on his pipes. There issued
forth the sound of a thousand sheep
all bleating at once but all in pain!
Sandy listened from his tent on the
hill opposite and chuckled to himself.</p>

<p>Roy was also in pain as he listened.
His delicate ears were unused to this
shrieking and squealing. He joined in
the din with loud howls.</p>

<p>The baby within the house was in
sympathy, too, and added her wails.</p>

<p>So Sandy's first evening as a resident
in Aberfoyle was not a quiet one.
He was forced to stop his ears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Craig was unable to stand the
racket. So she pulled her puffing son
into the house and packed him off to
bed, to the great relief of all.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus151.jpg" width="638" height="444"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE SOUND OF HIS PIPES ECHOED BACK THROUGH THE GLEN</p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>But Ian was a quick and hard-working
pupil. It was not long before Roy
quite approved of the sounds his master
made on his pipes. He did not then
feel it necessary to amend the
melody.</p>

<p>Also the baby gurgled with glee.
She puffed out her cheeks in imitation
of Ian and laughed happily.
And Betty, the lamb, too, seemed to
know that all was well. The world
was in tune with the wee Scotch piper
who had, at last, realized his dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE WEE SCOTCH PIPER</h3>


<p>It was a cloudless day in the big
Scotch city. The people seemed to
feel that something unusual was
about to happen. Everyone wore his
best, and the city fairly shone with
the reds and blues and greens of tartan
kilts and bonnets.</p>

<p>Soldiers paraded the streets. Children
hurried along by their parents'
sides, anxious to arrive at the big
grand stand in time. Numerous bystanders
flanked the wide street.</p>

<p>All the people were breathless with
excitement. Even the usual crowding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
traffic suspended its pushing and
shrill tooting. For this was a great
day in Scotland. Many celebrations
occur at intervals in this land of excursions
and picnics. But to-day was
as the children would say, "extra
special."</p>

<p>The huge grand stand was overcrowded
with eager Scotchmen, with
their wives and bairns. They all
strained their eyes for a glimpse of
the great "kiltie band," which was to
march down the street.</p>

<p>Among those who watched, and
perhaps the most eager of all, were a
family of country folk. In bobbing
black bonnet sat a calm-faced old
lady. Beside her was a rugged old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
man. Both were in their best array.
Both were longing for the sight they
had come miles from their little farm
to see.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus155.jpg" width="645" height="444"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE WEE SCOTCH PIPER</p>

<p>The couple were none other than
Alan Craig and his wife. The sight
that their old eyes would soon see, as
the happy tears dimmed their view,
would be their son, their Ian. He was
now a tall, manly piper in kilted uniform,
marching and piping with the
flower of Scotland's army.</p>

<p>By their side sat another. His
kindly face shone with pride, and in
his heart was a singing joy.</p>

<p>For Sandy MacGregor had taught
this lad to play. It was the same old
pipes of Sandy MacGregor that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
still used. He would soon show those
pipes to a cheering crowd as his fingers
flew over the chanter. While he
played, his arm would shelter the tartan
bellows once sheltered by Sandy's
own arm as the old piper had wandered
over hill and through dale.</p>

<p>Sandy MacGregor had lived many
years for this moment. As he craned
his neck for a sight of the coming parade,
he spoke to the little girl beside
him.</p>

<p>"See, Betty, 'tis they coming now."</p>

<p>Betty, Ian's baby sister, was now a
girl of the age Ian had been when first
Sandy had met him.</p>

<p>Together, Betty and Sandy had
dreamed and planned the day when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
together they would view their piper
laddie on parade.</p>

<p>For Sandy had dwelt in the village
of Aberfoyle these many years. While
he had piped for his living, he had
taught another piper, who was now to
cover his old teacher with glory.</p>

<p>In the large audience there was still
another, whose blue eyes danced with
joy. Her hands were clasped together
with excitement as she awaited the
approach of her boyhood friend. It
was little Elsie Campbell, now grown
to womanhood. Elsie was among
those who thrilled to see the "wee
Scotch piper," as he marched along
that day.</p>

<p>Who knows with what feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
pride the lad looked up as he passed
that grand stand? Who knows his feelings
of love, on seeing those dear
faces smiling and nodding at him?</p>

<p>And as he marched and played, he
seemed to see before him a little
schoolboy marching and playing. That
boy was himself, trudging the streets
of a wee village, followed by a bleating
lamb!</p>
